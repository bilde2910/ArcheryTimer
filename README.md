# Archery Timer

The Archery Timer is an archery timer just like any other, except it's completely free, even for commercial use. Like with other timers, you can choose how long each round should last, easily switch between AB and CD, and do anything else you'd normally do with an archery timer.

## Features

* Control the timer using single-display controls, or using a separate control panel
* Automatically download the timer for offline use
* Set the timer anywhere from 10 to 240 seconds
* All features available at the click of a button

## Production server

**The timer is available 24/7 on a public web server. You are encouraged to use this when operating the timer, as it allows updates to easily be distributed, and makes it easier for me to manage the project. [Access it here &gt;](https://apps.varden.info/archery/timer/)**

If you want to run this project locally, you are highly encouraged to run it from within a web server (any web server will work). Running it directly from the file system will result in reduced functionality.

## Licensing

## Freeware policy

I do not think it would be fair for me to require payment for usage of the online timer. I have made the project open source - I believe I should make something that the community as a whole can create and improve cooperatively. Access and usage is completely free, even for commercial purposes, but I will still accept donations. The reason for this is that even though I want to make things for the greater good, I still need to make a living. I won't be able to live off this timer, obviously, but any amount donated helps. I'll be picking up studies at university level in less than two years as of this post, and the cost of living, especially in Norway, isn't exactly low. So if you want to send some money my way, feel free to! There's a bitcoin link on my website, and once I turn 18, I'll be setting up a PayPal account as well, which would be linked here.

Even though I like sharing my work with the public, I would rather not have this project stolen. This is why I'm releasing this timer under the terms of the GPL. If you're writing software, you probably already know what that means, and you can probably imagine why I picked that license. It allows me to have an open source project that everyone can contribute to, fork, derive from or reproduce, but no company or individual may steal my code and incorporate it into their own project without their software also being open source. This allows the open source community to further grow, and will hopefully inspire more people to work on this, as well as related projects.
